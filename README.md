# Web Edge AI

![Sample Image](images/sample.png)

A lightweight JavaScript utility library designed for running local language models (LLMs) like Gemma 2B directly on edge devices. This project aims to provide developers with easy-to-use tools for integrating AI capabilities into web applications without relying on external servers, ensuring faster response times and enhanced privacy.

## Features

### Text

- [Text Generation, Summarization, Translation, Chatbot](https://ai.google.dev/edge/mediapipe/solutions/genai/llm_inference/web_js)
- [Information extraction](https://github.com/nico-martin/ask-my-pdf)
- [Text Sentiment Analysis](https://mediapipe-studio.webapps.google.com/studio/demo/text_classifier)
- [Language Detection](https://mediapipe-studio.webapps.google.com/studio/demo/language_detector)

## Image

Take images as inputs and can answer questions about images with detail and context. It can perform deeper analysis of images and provide useful insights, such as captioning for images and short videos, object detection, and reading text embedded within images.

## Tasks

Through a chat interface, able to understand the user intent, extract parameters through conversation and map the API calls to the right API services.

## Video

- Video Object Detection: Detect objects in videos. For example, you can use this feature to identify cars in a traffic video.

- Face Recognition: Recognize faces in videos. For example, you can use this feature to identify people in a surveillance video or place a mask/glasses on a live webcam stream.

- Gesture Classification: Recognize gestures in videos. For example, you can use this feature to detect hand movements in a video or on webcam.

## Audio

- Transcription: Transcribe audio files. For example, you can use this feature to convert a podcast episode into text.

- Audio Classification: Classify audio files. For example, you can use this feature to identify the genre of a music track.

- Speech Commands: Recognize speech commands. For example, you can use this feature to control a smart home device using voice commands.

## Code

Generate code snippets. For example, you can can perform a variety of coding tasks like fill-in-the-middle code completion, code generation, natural language understanding, mathematical reasoning, and instruction following.
